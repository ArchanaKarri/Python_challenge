# Python_challenge
This Pyhton challenge contains 2 different programs. One is for PyBank and the other one is for PyPoll.

PyBank 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used a Python script to analyse the financial records of a company with the  given  financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My Python scrip  analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis with the given data will produe the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
With this code, my final script is analysed and the output is printed to the terminal and copy of it is exported to a text file named test.txt  in the Analysis folder with the results.

PyPoll
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this Challenge, my code is tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.

With the  given  set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My code  is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

My code will analyse the output from the given data and align with the following results:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
-------------------------
With this code, my final script is analysed and the output is printed to the terminal and copy of it is exported to a text file named test.txt  in the Analysis folder with the results.
